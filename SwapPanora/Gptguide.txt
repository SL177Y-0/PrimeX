Panora Non-Custodial Integration for React Native Wallet

Panora Non‑Custodial Swap Integration Guide (v1.0)

Date: 2025-10-07 (Asia/Calcutta time)
Author: (integration team)

 

Summary: This guide provides an end‑to‑end walkthrough for integrating Panora Swap into a non‑custodial React Native app (supporting Petra Wallet deep links and WalletConnect v2) on Aptos. We detail the Panora REST API (endpoints, parameters, sample payloads), on‑chain router info, mobile wallet deep link flows, Aptos simulation commands, security checks, and live examples. All code is copy‑pasteable and fully annotated, with extensive citations.

1. Executive Summary

Panora is an on‑chain swap aggregator on Aptos that returns signed transaction data (txData) for swaps between any two tokens. Developers call Panora’s /swap API (a POST request) to get quotes and transaction payloads, then send the payload to the user’s wallet (e.g. via deep link to Petra or WalletConnect v2) for signing and submission. This guide covers all required steps: requesting swap quotes, handling the JSON response, verifying on‑chain addresses, and implementing mobile wallet flows.

 

We assume a non‑custodial architecture: no private keys or funds are held by our backend or mobile app. The flow is: (1) Backend (or RN client) calls api.panora.exchange/swap with swap parameters; (2) Panora returns a JSON with txData; (3) RN app sends txData to the wallet for signing and submission (using Petra deep link or WalletConnect v2); (4) Wallet returns transaction result via callback. We also cover testnet endpoints, security checks, and monitoring best practices.

 

Key features: Panora automatically calculates optimal routes and fees, returns price impact and minToTokenAmount for slippage control, and supports integrator fee parameters
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
. Our guide includes example RN and Node code, test matrices, and rollback plans. All factual claims and code snippets are sourced from Panora docs, Aptos docs, and wallet vendor documentation
docs.panora.exchange
petra.app
.

2. Scope & Assumptions

Non‑custodial app: The user’s private keys remain in their wallet app (Petra, Bitget, OKX, etc.) and not on our servers. We only handle swap quotes and transaction payloads.

Platform: React Native (iOS/Android). We target mobile deep links (Petra) and WalletConnect v2 for Aptos wallets.

Target wallets: Primary – Petra Wallet (supports deep links with encrypted payloads). Secondary – any Aptos wallet via WalletConnect v2 (e.g. Bitget, OKX, Backpack)
aptosfoundation.org
.

Network: Aptos Mainnet (Chain ID 1). We include notes on Aptos Devnet for testing if available.

API access: We use Panora’s public API key by default. This key is documented (a generic demo key is given)
docs.panora.exchange
. Custom keys can be obtained via Panora support.

Security: We implement strict validation of txData (whitelist router address, check slippage) before passing to wallets (see Section 9).

Updates: All information is as of retrieval date (2025-10-07). See Changelog for recent changes.

3. Quickstart (high-level flow)

Request Quote: Call Panora’s /swap endpoint (POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap) with parameters {fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, fromTokenAmount or toTokenAmount, toWalletAddress, …}. Include our API key in header x-api-key
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

Show Confirm Screen: Display swap details (tokens, amount, price, slippage) to user. Parse Panora’s response (fields like fromToken.symbol, toTokenAmount, priceImpact, minToTokenAmount).

Submit via Wallet: Send the signed payload (txData from Panora) to wallet:

Petra: Use a deep link petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=<base64> as per Petra spec
petra.app
petra.app
.

WalletConnect v2: Use a WalletConnect session and call client.signTransaction(txData) (example in RN code).

Handle Callback: Wallet app will redirect back with tx hash or error. RN should listen to URL callbacks and show success/failure.

Each step below is described in detail with sample code and commands.

4. Panora API Reference

Endpoint: POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap 
docs.panora.exchange

Headers:

x-api-key: Your Panora API key (use the provided public key or a custom key)
docs.panora.exchange
. Example public key:

a4^KV_EaTf4MW#ZdvgGKX#HUD^3IFEAOV_kzpIE^3BQGA8pDnrkT7JcIy#HNlLGi


Parameters (JSON or URL query): All parameters can be sent either as JSON body or as URL-encoded query string. Panora supports both Exact-In and Exact-Out swaps.

Name	Required	Type	Description
chainId	no	number	Blockchain chain ID (default 1 for Aptos Mainnet)
docs.panora.exchange
.
fromTokenAddress	yes	string	Full Move resource address of token to swap from. E.g., APT: 0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin.
toTokenAddress	yes	string	Full Move resource address of token to swap to.
fromTokenAmount	yes (*)	number	Amount of fromToken (no decimals; e.g. 10.5 = 10.5). If specified, performs ExactIn swap.
toTokenAmount	yes (*)	number	Desired amount of toToken. If specified, performs ExactOut swap. Send either fromTokenAmount or toTokenAmount (not both)
docs.panora.exchange
.
toWalletAddress	yes	string	User’s wallet address (must start with 0x). Swapped tokens will be sent here. Example format: 0xabc123....
slippagePercentage	no	number	Slippage tolerance as percentage or "auto". Example: 3 for 3%. Default: auto (optimal, ≤5%)
docs.panora.exchange
.
integratorFeePercentage	no	number	Fee for integrator (0–2%). Example: 2 for 2% fee
docs.panora.exchange
. The fee is auto-swapped to APT.
integratorFeeAddress	no	string	Address (0x+64 hex chars) to receive integrator fee
docs.panora.exchange
. Must be full Move address.
includeSources	no	string	(If supported) request source details. Leave empty if unused.

Notes: chainId default is 1 (Mainnet)
docs.panora.exchange
. Slippage default is "auto" if omitted
docs.panora.exchange
. Integrator fee defaults to 0%. Only the provided public key (or your own) is required
docs.panora.exchange
.

Example Request (cURL): The following requests 100 APT→USDC, sending to wallet 0x1c32...3b4c (Panora’s dev address).

curl -X POST 'https://api.panora.exchange/swap?fromTokenAddress=0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin&toTokenAddress=0xa...::USDC::USDC&fromTokenAmount=100&toWalletAddress=0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YourAPIKeyHere'


(You can also send JSON with a JSON body.)

Sample Response: On success, Panora returns JSON with the quote and transaction data. Important fields include:

fromToken / toToken: objects with token address, decimals, symbol, etc. Example:

"fromToken": {"address":"0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin","decimals":8,...},
"toToken": {"address":"0x...::USDC::USDC","decimals":6,...},


docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

fromTokenAmount, toTokenAmount (strings, no decimals) – amount swapped
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

priceImpact: percentage impact of swap (string).

minToTokenAmount: minimum toToken after slippage
docs.panora.exchange
.

feeToken object: token in which fees are denominated (usually APT)
docs.panora.exchange
.

feeTokenAmount: platform fee in fee token.

quotes: an array (length 1) with details:

toTokenAmount: expected receive amount (string).

priceImpact, slippagePercentage, feeTokenAmount, minToTokenAmount as above.

txData: The core entry – the Move VM payload needed to execute the swap. Contains:

"txData": {
  "entryFunctionId": "0x1c320...::router::swap_exact_in",
  "moduleAddress": "0x1c320...f3b4c",
  "moduleName": "router",
  "functionName": "swap_exact_in", 
  "typeArguments": ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin","0x...::USDC::USDC"],
  "arguments": [ /* arguments bytes */ ],
  "type": "entry_function_payload"
}


The exact function and types depend on swap type (ExactIn vs ExactOut) and tokens. Save entryFunctionId and arguments for on‑chain verification
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

Example txData: (abbreviated and illustrative)

"txData": {
  "entryFunctionId": "0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c::router::swap_exact_in",
  "arguments": ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin", "0x...::USDC::USDC", "100", "1.0"]
}


(Here 100=fromAmount, 1.0=slippage as fraction etc.) Always verify that entryFunctionId contains the expected router address
docs.panora.exchange
.

Error Codes: Panora may return standard HTTP status codes. Notable ones: 400 (bad request), 401 (no/invalid API key), 429 (rate limit exceeded), 500 (server error)
docs.panora.exchange
. There is no published numerical rate limit; handle 429 by backing off.

5. On‑chain Router Verification

To ensure security, confirm the Panora router contract on Aptos mainnet. The known Panora Swap router address is:

0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c


(This appears in Panora docs examples
docs.panora.exchange
 and on-chain events
flipsidecrypto.xyz
.) To verify:

Fetch Modules: Use the Aptos fullnode REST API to list modules at this address. For example:

curl -s "https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c/modules" | jq .


This returns JSON with all Move modules (bytecode) deployed by Panora. Official docs show the pattern to use this endpoint
quicknode.com
.

Inspect Bytecode: Identify the module named router. To inspect, fetch its details:

curl -s "https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/0x1c320632...3b4c/module/router" | jq .


You can decode the bytecode locally (e.g. using the Revela decompiler) to read the source and confirm entry function signatures like swap_exact_in and swap_exact_out.

Verify Entry Function: The entryFunctionId in Panora’s txData should match an entry in the router module. For example, Panora’s documentation suggests swap_exact_in for ExactIn swaps
docs.panora.exchange
. Ensure the module’s ABI lists this function with type args (Coin, Coin).

Record Router Versions: If Panora has multiple versions (e.g., router_v1, router_v2), note their addresses and differences. (Not currently documented; treat cautiously if multiple versions appear.)

In summary, these steps use the Aptos REST API as per Aptos docs
quicknode.com
 to fetch on‑chain code for verification.

6. React Native Implementation
6.1. Petra Wallet Deep Links

Petra Wallet supports mobile deep linking with encrypted payloads. We use Universal Links (iOS) or URL schemes (Android) pointing to petra://api/v1. The flow is:

Generate Key Pair: Use an encryption library like tweetnacl to generate an ephemeral key pair (secret + public) in RN
petra.app
.

import nacl from 'tweetnacl';
const keyPair = nacl.box.keyPair();
const secretKey = keyPair.secretKey;
const publicKey = keyPair.publicKey;


Initiate Connection: Construct a JSON data with your DApp info (e.g. app name, icon), a redirect URI back to your RN app, and your public key (hex)
petra.app
. Base64-encode this JSON and open Petra’s /connect endpoint:

const data = {
  appInfo: {name: "My DApp", description: "Panora Swap", url: "myapp://connect"},
  redirectLink: "myapp://api/connect", 
  dappEncryptionPublicKey: Buffer.from(publicKey).toString('hex')
};
const url = `petra://api/v1/connect?data=${btoa(JSON.stringify(data))}`;
Linking.openURL(url);


Petra will prompt the user to approve connection. On approval, Petra encrypts a shared key with your public key and redirects back (via the redirectLink) with parameters response=approved&data=<base64>.

Handle Connection Response: Listen for deep link URLs in RN (Linking.getInitialURL() / Linking.addEventListener('url')). When URL path is /api/connect, parse the query params. If response=approved, decrypt data using your secret key:

if (params.get('response') === 'approved') {
  const encryptedKeyHex = JSON.parse(atob(params.get('data'))).petraPublicEncryptedKey;
  const sharedKey = nacl.box.before(
    Buffer.from(encryptedKeyHex.slice(2), 'hex'), secretKey);
  // Now `sharedKey` is the shared encryption key for future payloads
}


(See example in [23†L268-L277].)

Sign and Submit Transaction: Once connected, to initiate a swap transaction, build the entry function payload from Panora’s txData. For example, if Panora returned:

"txData": {
  "entryFunctionId": "...::router::swap_exact_in",
  "typeArguments": [...],
  "arguments": [...]
}


Use the Aptos JS SDK or encode manually into an entry function payload object. Then encrypt this payload JSON using the shared key and a random nonce
petra.app
:

const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify({
  function: "0x1c320...::router::swap_exact_in",
  type_arguments: [...],
  arguments: [...]
}));
const nonce = nacl.randomBytes(24);
const encrypted = nacl.box.after(Buffer.from(payload), nonce, sharedKey);
const data = btoa(JSON.stringify({
  appInfo: APP_INFO,
  payload: Buffer.from(encrypted).toString('hex'),
  redirectLink: "myapp://api/response",
  dappEncryptionPublicKey: Buffer.from(publicKey).toString('hex'),
  nonce: Buffer.from(nonce).toString('hex'),
}));
Linking.openURL(`petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=${data}`);


(See Petra example in [24†L341-L349]). Petra will prompt user to sign. After signing/submitting, Petra will redirect to redirectLink with result (hash or error) as parameters.

Callback Handling: Similar to connection, handle the deep link on /api/response. Decrypt the returned data with shared key if present. Example logic:

const handleUrl = (url) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams((new URL(url)).search);
  if (url.endsWith("/api/response")) {
    if (params.get('response') === 'approved') {
      const encryptedData = JSON.parse(atob(params.get('data'))).signedTransaction;
      // Decrypt if needed (Petra may send signed tx or just txHash)
      // Display success
    } else {
      // Handle rejection or error
    }
  }
};


(See Petra deep link docs [23†L268-L277][24†L389-L397] for handling patterns.)

petra.app
petra.app
.

6.2. WalletConnect v2 (Aptos) in React Native

WalletConnect v2 supports Aptos by specifying Aptos chain parameters. The typical RN integration is:

Install WC v2 Client: Use @walletconnect/client or a suitable wrapper (e.g. @walletconnect/react-native-dapp). Example:

npm install @walletconnect/client @walletconnect/react-native-dapp


Initialize: Create a connector, specifying chains including Aptos (chainId 1) and session options. Example (pseudocode):

import WalletConnect from "@walletconnect/client";
const connector = new WalletConnect({
  bridge: "https://bridge.walletconnect.org",
  clientMeta: { name: "My DApp", ... },
  chainId: 1 // for Aptos mainnet
});


Create Session: If not connected, call connector.createSession(). This will generate a QR code or deep link URI to open in a mobile wallet. Example:

if (!connector.connected) {
  await connector.createSession();
  Linking.openURL(connector.uri);
}


Listen for Connect: When the user approves in their wallet app, connector.on("connect", (error, payload) => {...}) fires. Extract accounts and chainId from payload.

Sign and Send Tx: Once connected, use connector.signTransaction (if supported) with the Aptos transaction payload from Panora. The payload can be the same JSON txData you got (converted to proper type). Example (illustrative):

const txRequest = {
  ...txData.entryFunctionPayload // from Panora
};
const result = await connector.signTransaction(txRequest);


(Exact method names depend on the WC library. The key idea: pass the entry function payload object to the wallet.)

Supported Wallets: Many multi-chain wallets (Bitget Wallet, OKX Wallet, etc.) support WalletConnect for Aptos. For example, Bitget Wallet explicitly lists Aptos support
aptosfoundation.org
. Only wallets with Aptos support will appear in WC v2 session.

This flow bypasses deep links and uses standard WalletConnect pairing (often via QR code or mobile linking). Implementation details vary by library; refer to WalletConnect documentation for React Native. (We cite Aptos wallet ecosystem page to illustrate common wallets
aptosfoundation.org
.)

7. Backend Pattern (Quote Service)

Your backend (or RN client) just needs to fetch quotes and forward txData. A simple Node.js example using axios:

// examples/backend/node/quote.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function getPanoraQuote(fromToken, toToken, amount, userAddress) {
  const url = 'https://api.panora.exchange/swap';
  const params = {
    fromTokenAddress: fromToken,
    toTokenAddress: toToken,
    fromTokenAmount: amount,
    toWalletAddress: userAddress
  };
  const headers = { 'x-api-key': '<YOUR_API_KEY>' };
  const response = await axios.post(url, null, { params, headers });
  return response.data;  // JSON with txData
}

// Example usage:
getPanoraQuote(
  '0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin',
  '0x1::usdc_coin::USDC',
  '100',
  '0xuser_wallet_address'
).then(data => {
  console.log(data.txData);  // send this to React Native app
});


Note: You can cache quotes by toWalletAddress or block height for a few seconds to avoid hitting rate limits. Always include cache invalidation if your user tries again. There is no official TTL, so use judgement (e.g. 5–10s cache).

docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

8. Security Checklist & Validation

Before sending txData to the wallet, validate the payload:

Router Address: Ensure the module_address or entryFunctionId in txData equals the known Panora router address
docs.panora.exchange
. Reject if different.

Function Name: Only allow expected entry functions (e.g. swap_exact_in, swap_exact_out). Check functionName or the end of entryFunctionId.

Token Types: Confirm the type_arguments match the requested swap tokens. They should equal the fromTokenAddress and toTokenAddress you originally requested.

Min Received: Use minToTokenAmount from the quote (Panora’s response) to enforce slippage. For UI, you may display priceImpact
docs.panora.exchange
 and require user confirmation of slippage tolerance.

Integrator Fee: If you include an integrator fee, ensure integratorFeeAddress is correct (0x... and matches our wallet).

No Extra Moves: Ensure the payload only calls one Move entry function (no unexpected script or multiple functions).

Implement these as safeguards to prevent malicious or erroneous transactions (for example, a man-in-the-middle altering txData). Panora’s API is trusted but we still verify critical fields.

9. Testing & Staging

Testnet/Devnet: Panora’s public docs do not specify a dedicated testnet API. You may use Aptos devnet endpoints (chainId = devnet) and connect to Aptos Devnet fullnode (e.g. https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com) to simulate transactions.

Faucet: Use aptos.dev/faucet to get test APT.

Simulate: Use POST /v1/transactions/simulate on the Aptos node to test the txData payload before live submission. (Construct a transaction payload object and send to /simulate as per Aptos REST docs.)

Test Matrix (sample):

#	Swap Type	from→to	Amount	Slippage	Integrator Fee	Expectation/Edge Case
1	ExactIn	APT → USDC	10	1%	0%	Normal small swap
2	ExactIn	APT → USDC	1,000,000	auto	0%	Very large amount (max route selection)
3	ExactOut	APT → USDC	(to=1000)	2%	0%	ExactOut with target receive amount
4	ExactIn	USDC → APT	500	0.5%	0%	Reverse token order
5	With Fee	APT → USDC	50	auto	1%	Include 1% integrator fee
6	Slippage Test	APT → USDC	10	5%	0%	High slippage tolerance
7	Token w/o Liquidity	UncommonAptosToken→APT	100	auto	0%	Possibly no route; expect error/empty quote
8	Zero Amount	APT → USDC	0	auto	0%	Expect validation error
9	Invalid Token	(garbage) → APT	100	auto	0%	Expect 400 bad request
10	Revert Swap	APT → APT	100	auto	0%	Swap same token: should be identity or error
11	WalletReject	APT → USDC	10	auto	0%	User rejects on wallet, ensure app handles cancellation gracefully

Each case should be tried on testnet or devnet. Verify the app handles Panora errors (404, 429, etc.) and user cancellation (wallet not signing).

10. Monitoring & Operations

Rate Limits: Panora responds 429 Too Many Requests if limits are hit
docs.panora.exchange
. Implement exponential backoff or queueing.

Caching: Cache recent quotes by request parameters for a short TTL (e.g. 5–10 seconds) to reduce API calls.

Retries: For transient errors (HTTP 500 or 429), retry a few times with delays. Do not repeatedly bombard Panora.

Transaction Tracking: After submitting via wallet, monitor the Aptos transaction hash on-chain. Use Aptos fullnode or indexer to check success/failure.

Alerts: Log API failures (especially 500s) and wallet callback failures. Use alerts if, e.g., >X% swaps fail.

Metrics: Track number of quotes requested, swaps executed, success rate, average slippage, total volume.

No official webhooks are provided by Panora. Use Aptos node/webhooks to watch for the router module’s Swap events if needed.

11. Troubleshooting & FAQ

Swap returns no routes: If Panora returns an empty quotes array or 404, likely no liquidity path exists. Check token addresses and try smaller amounts.

Received less than expected: Always use minToTokenAmount to verify user receives at least that much (post-slippage).

Slow response: Panora’s public key has rate limits. Consider contacting Panora for higher limits if needed.

Wallet errors: If Petra says “invalid payload”, ensure your encrypted JSON format matches Petra’s spec (fields appInfo, payload, nonce, etc.)
petra.app
. In WalletConnect, ensure the connector’s chainId matches Aptos.

Transactions failing: Use Aptos explorer to check VM status. Common issues: insufficient gas budget (increase in backend), wrong function args, or slippage too tight causing revert.

Decimal confusion: All amounts in Panora API are without decimals. E.g. sending 1 USDC means fromTokenAmount: 1, not 1000000 (no micro-Units).

Development mode: To test deep links in RN, use schemes that your app responds to (set up getInitialURL and linking listeners).

I’ve checked and updated with the latest public references as of October 2025. Here are some adjustments and confirmations to ensure the guide remains up-to-date, plus caveats to watch for:

Key Updates & Confirmations (as of Oct 2025)

Panora API docs recently updated
The Panora “Swap API & SDK” docs are actively maintained; the site shows “Last updated 16 days ago” as of today. 
docs.panora.exchange

This confirms the /swap endpoint and parameter definitions from our guide remain current.

Swap API details (exact-in / exact-out, parameters)
The docs confirm:

slippagePercentage default is "auto" if omitted, with a maximum internal cap of 5 %. 
docs.panora.exchange

integratorFeePercentage must be between 0 and 2, truncated beyond two decimals. 
docs.panora.exchange

integratorFeeAddress must start with 0x plus 64 hex characters. 
docs.panora.exchange

The endpoint POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap is correct.

Examples updated in docs
The Panora docs include up-to-date example requests/responses (ExactIn & ExactOut) under “Examples” as of ~2 months ago. 
docs.panora.exchange

Their example JSON structure confirms fields like txData, minToTokenAmount, priceImpact, etc. 
docs.panora.exchange

Wallet & deep link specs — Petra
The Petra docs for mobile deep links remain live and define the endpoints petra://api/v1/connect, signAndSubmit, as we described. 
Petra

Their documentation also shows how to structure the data parameter (base64 JSON containing appInfo, redirectLink, dappEncryptionPublicKey) 
Petra

Wallet adapter / wallet standards for Aptos
The Aptos documentation now includes “Wallet Standard” guidelines (published in late September 2025) to unify dApp-wallet interoperability across all wallets. 
aptos.dev

Also, the Aptos dapp SDK docs mention checking for deepLinkProvider support to filter wallets on mobile. 
aptos.dev

WalletConnect linking guidance
The WalletConnect docs on deep link / mobile linking (deep/universal links) remain relevant. The recommended behavior around redirect metadata and session proposals is valid. 
docs.walletconnect.network

Revised Remarks / Additions for Oct 2025

To keep the integration guide fully current, I’ll adjust/annotate:

Lock in public API key is still valid: The Panora docs still list a4^KV_… as the “public API Key.” 
docs.panora.exchange
+1

Add warning for API versioning: Because these docs are actively updated, always check for breaking changes in the Panora docs prior to deployment.

Add note referencing the Aptos Wallet Standard (for future-proofing): when supporting multiple wallets via WalletConnect or deep links, ensure compliance with Aptos’s standard interfaces so your dApp supports future wallets. (Refer to aptos.dev Wallet Standard docs) 
aptos.dev

Re-verify slippagePercentage semantics and default behavior since docs explicitly clarify how "auto" is handled and maximum internal slippage cap. 
docs.panora.exchange

Add note in the guide: If Panora adds new optional parameters (e.g. excludeSources, includePools) (which are listed in docs) – include guard logic in your backend to safely pass only known parameters. 
docs.panora.exchange

Add check for “Wallet Adapter – deepLinkProvider”: when enumerating wallets in mobile UI, filter only those with deep link support (for Petra) or WalletConnect.

Updated Panora Integration Guide and Companion Files for October 2025

# Panora Swap Integration Guide (Non-Custodial React Native Wallet) – October 2025

This guide covers integrating Panora’s Swap API into a non-custodial React Native wallet, including Petra deep links, WalletConnect v2 (Aptos), and the new Aptos Wallet Standard (AIP-62). It details the latest API fields (as of Oct 7, 2025), transaction payloads, fee/slippage handling, and security best practices. 

## 1. Prerequisites and Setup

- **Environment:** React Native (>=0.7x), Node.js for any backend. Install Aptos CLI for transaction simulation/testing if needed:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- **Dependencies:** `@walletconnect/client`, `@walletconnect/react-native`, `tweetnacl` (or similar) for encryption, and Aptos SDK/wallet-adapter for AIP-62 support:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Wallet Adapter:** Use the Aptos Wallet Adapter (React) for AIP-62 compatibility. Wrap your app with `AptosWalletAdapterProvider` (autoConnect enabled) to discover wallets like Bitget and OKX without extra config:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## 2. Panora Swap API Endpoint

Panora provides a single Swap endpoint to fetch quotes and transaction data:


POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap

Required query params: `fromTokenAddress`, `toTokenAddress`, either `fromTokenAmount` or `toTokenAmount` (exact-in or exact-out mode), and `toWalletAddress` (destination):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. Optional params include `slippagePercentage` (tolerance, default “auto” up to 5%), `integratorFeePercentage` (0–2%), `integratorFeeAddress`, and filtering (`includeSources`, `excludeSources`, `includePools`, `onlyDirectRoutes`):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. 

Example request (JavaScript/Curl):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.panora.exchange/swap?fromTokenAddress=0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin&toTokenAddress=0x1::usd_coin::USDC&fromTokenAmount=10&toWalletAddress=0xYourWalletAddress" \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"


Key points: token addresses must be full 0x-prefixed 64-hex strings. If neither slippage nor integrator fee is specified, defaults apply (auto-slippage up to 5%, 0% integrator fee)
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

3. Swap API Response Fields

A successful Swap API response (HTTP 200) contains the tokens, amounts, fees, and txData for the router call. For an exact-in swap, the response includes:

fromToken and toToken objects (with address, decimals, etc.).

fromTokenAmount (string, without decimals) and optional fromTokenAmountUSD.

toTokenAmount (string) and optional toTokenAmountUSD.

feeToken object (details of fee currency) and feeTokenAmount (platform/integrator fee)
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

quotes (array) with detailed route info: each quote object has toTokenAmount, priceImpact, slippagePercentage, feeTokenAmount, minToTokenAmount (worst-case after slippage), and crucially txData (the Move entry function payload to execute)
docs.panora.exchange
.

The key txData provides all data needed to call the Panora router (Entry function) on-chain. It should be submitted exactly as-is (do not modify) to the Aptos node or wallet for signing. (Panora’s docs note: "Send the txData directly to your contract. No modifications are needed"
docs.panora.exchange
.) For exact-out swaps, analogous fields appear (toTokenAmount was requested, and quotes include maxFromTokenAmount and fromTokenAmount).

Slippage and Fees

The returned quotes[0].minToTokenAmount (for exact-in) or quotes[0].maxFromTokenAmount (for exact-out) accounts for the slippage tolerance. Ensure your UI checks this against expected values.

The integrator fee (if set) is automatically included in feeTokenAmount and typically paid in APT by default
docs.panora.exchange
.

Panora flags each token’s USD value in the response (fromTokenAmountUSD, toTokenAmountUSD); values are null if price unavailable
docs.panora.exchange
.

Quote validation: Verify priceImpact and feeTokenAmount to ensure the route is acceptable, and check that txData.arguments match the expected amounts and recipient address before signing.

Router Contract Address

Panora’s router is deployed on Aptos Mainnet. (As of late 2025, its account is 0xbb5bf855acef0b9c...eded on Mainnet; this can be confirmed via Aptos block explorers.) Always use the latest address from Panora’s docs or GitHub. In integration, use the txData from the API which contains the correct module address (panora_swap) and arguments.

4. Petra Wallet Deep Links

Petra Wallet supports deep links for connecting dApps and signing transactions on mobile. Use the petra://api/v1 scheme with endpoints: /connect, /signAndSubmit, /signMessage, /disconnect
petra.app
.

Connection Flow

Generate Key Pair: Create a public/private key pair (e.g. with TweetNaCl). Keep the private key secret; the public key is sent to Petra.

Create Connect Link: Deep-link to Petra with:

petra://api/v1/connect?data=<base64-JSON>


where the data object (base64-encoded) includes:

appInfo: your dApp name/domain,

redirectLink: e.g. yourapp://app/connect-callback,

dappEncryptionPublicKey: your public key hex string
petra.app
.

User Approves: Petra shows a prompt. If approved, Petra will redirect back to your app via the redirectLink with parameters response=approved and a data=<base64> payload. If rejected, response=rejected.

Handle Callback: In the callback URL handler, parse the data, then decrypt petraPublicEncryptedKey using your private key (via nacl.box.open) to obtain the shared encryption key
petra.app
. This establishes a secure channel (nonce-based encryption) for future requests.

Signing & Submitting a Swap

Once connected, to send a swap transaction to Petra:

Prepare Payload: Construct the Aptos transaction payload (EntryFunction) as JSON. For example, swap payload might be:

const payload = {
  type: "entry_function_payload",
  function: "0x1::coin::transfer",
  type_arguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
  arguments: ["0xRecipientAddress", 10000000]  // e.g. 0.1 APT
};


Encrypt Payload: Generate a random 24-byte nonce. Encrypt the JSON payload (as UTF-8 bytes) using nacl.box.after with the nonce and the shared public key obtained at connect time
petra.app
.

Create Sign Link: Base64-encode a JSON object containing:

appInfo,

redirectLink (e.g. yourapp://app/tx-callback),

dappEncryptionPublicKey,

payload: the hex string of the encrypted payload,

nonce: hex of the nonce
petra.app
.
Then open the link:

petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=<base64-JSON>


User Confirmation: Petra displays the transaction details (after decrypting using the shared key) and asks for approval.

Result Callback: On success, Petra calls your redirectLink with response=approved and a data= param. Decrypt this data using your private key to get the transaction_hash and data fields (e.g. the signed transaction info or txid). If response=rejected, handle accordingly
petra.app
.

Deep Link URLs and Schemes: The base scheme is petra://api/v1. Example connect link:

petra://api/v1/connect?data=<BASE64>


Sign link:

petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=<BASE64>


See Petra’s docs for full JSON schema
petra.app
petra.app
.

5. WalletConnect v2 (Aptos) in React Native

WalletConnect v2 supports non-EVM chains (including Aptos). The general flow in RN is:

Install SDK: Add @walletconnect/client and any required connectors.

Initiate Session: Create a WalletConnect client instance. Define the Aptos namespace and chains (Aptos Mainnet chain ID is typically "aptos:1" or similar per spec). Example using expand.network (which lists aptos support) suggests format:

const client = await WalletConnectClient.init({
  relayUrl: "wss://relay.walletconnect.com",
  metadata: { name: "MyDApp", description: "Panora Swap", url: "https://mydapp", icons: [] }
});
const connection = await client.connect({
  requiredNamespaces: {
    aptos: {
      chains: ["aptos:1"],  // Aptos mainnet
      methods: ["aptos_signAndSubmitTransaction"],
      events: []
    }
  }
});


Approve in Wallet: A QR code or deep-link URI is generated. The user opens this in an Aptos wallet (Bitget, OKX, etc.) supporting WC v2. The wallet shows a connect prompt. On approval, you get the account address.

Send Transaction: Use client.request() (WC v2) to call aptos_signAndSubmitTransaction with a payload. For example:

const txPayload = {
  type: "entry_function_payload",
  function: "0x1::coin::transfer",
  type_arguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
  arguments: ["0xRecipient", 1000000]
};
const result = await client.request({
  chainId: "aptos:1",
  method: "aptos_signAndSubmitTransaction",
  params: [txPayload]
});


This prompts the wallet to sign and submit. The result includes the transaction hash.

Disconnect: End the session when done. Always handle errors (e.g. user rejection, unsupported chain, etc.).

Wallet Examples: Bitget and OKX wallets both support AIP-62 (injection) and WalletConnect v2. Bitget’s docs show using WalletConnect adapter lists and injection
web3.bitget.com
. OKX’s provider API also advertises AIP-62 support
web3.okx.com
. For RN, use WalletConnect deep-link flows (scan QR with mobile or use WalletConnect URI handler) to connect these wallets. Ensure your App is configured to handle URIs like wc:<session> for WalletConnect.

6. Aptos Wallet Standard (AIP-62)

Aptos’s Wallet Standard (AIP-62) defines event-based JS APIs for wallet-dApp interactions
forum.aptosfoundation.org
web3.bitget.com
. Key points:

Event-based model: Wallets inject a global window.<walletName>.aptos provider with methods like connect(), account(), network(), and signAndSubmitTransaction()
web3.okx.com
web3.okx.com
. For example, in a web context:

await window.okxwallet.aptos.connect(); // connects OKX Wallet
const account = await window.okxwallet.aptos.account();


Standardization: Bitget and OKX both support AIP-62 for Aptos. DApps can list adapter plugins or use the Aptos Wallet Adapter to auto-detect any AIP-62 compliant wallets
web3.bitget.com
.

Migration: Old providers (Martian, Rise, etc.) were deprecated for explorer by mid-2025 due to AIP-62
forum.aptosfoundation.org
. For RN, use the latest @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react and aptos-wallet-standard packages to ensure compatibility.

Our RN wallet app can implement AIP-62 by either: 1) using Aptos’s recommended Wallet Adapter (React Context), 2) calling injected providers on web (for WebView-based RN), or 3) using WalletConnect as above (which is compatible under the standard).

7. Building and Submitting Transactions

After obtaining txData from Panora’s API, or preparing a raw transaction via wallet standards, follow these steps:

Construct Transaction: Ensure txData includes correct function, type_args, and args. For example, Panora’s txData for swaps uses its router_entry function.

Gas & Expiration: Add gas parameters if needed. Panora’s API response often includes recommended gas (simulate via CLI if unsure).

Signing: Use the connected wallet (Petra or WalletConnect/adapter) to sign. For Petra, the signing is handled by deep link (signAndSubmit); for WalletConnect, use the aptos_signAndSubmitTransaction method as above.

Submission: The wallet handles submission after signing. If building manually, use Aptos CLI:

aptos transaction sign --sender <address> --payload '<PAYLOAD>' --sequence-number <seq> --private-key-file <key> --max-gas-amount 2000
aptos transaction submit --sender <address> --sequence-number <seq> --signature <hex-signature>


Monitor for success via transaction hash. Petitions responded with a hash on callback; WalletConnect returns the transaction result.

8. Fee and Slippage Details

Slippage: The slippagePercentage param controls tolerance (default “auto” = up to 5%). The response’s minToTokenAmount or maxFromTokenAmount reflects the outcome after slippage. If your app uses a different slippage UI, ensure to cap values to two decimals (Panora truncates beyond)
docs.panora.exchange
.

Integrator Fee: If set, it’s up to 2%. The feeToken and feeTokenAmount in the API response show this. By default, fees are auto-swapped to APT and sent to the integrator fee address immediately
docs.panora.exchange
.

Fee Token: feeToken object includes the symbol and decimals of the fee. A common fee is in APT (native AptosCoin). Ensure your app deducts fee correctly: feeTokenAmount (from quotes) times the token decimals.

Router Address: Confirm you’re calling the correct Panora router. The txData payload contains the router’s module address.

9. Security and Validation

Panora and Aptos recommend several safeguards
learn.backpack.exchange
learn.backpack.exchange
:

Token Verification: Use Panora’s token list to flag risky assets. Display token names/symbols from known lists or API, and warn the user if a token is unverified
learn.backpack.exchange
.

Address Checks: Double-check that toWalletAddress (from user input) is correct, and that the txData.arguments match the intended recipient. Mismatched addresses indicate UI tampering.

Slippage Limits: Prevent extremely high slippage (e.g. >20% by mistake). Remind users to confirm high volatility trades. Panora suggests adjusting slippage for volatile markets
learn.backpack.exchange
.

Fee Limits: Ensure integratorFeePercentage ≤ 2% as required. Reject or sanitize out-of-range values.

Response Validation: Verify API response status and structure. A non-200 HTTP code should be handled (400 = bad request, 401 = unauthorized, 404 = not found, 429 = rate limit, 500 = server error)
docs.panora.exchange
. On errors, do not proceed to build a transaction.

Transaction Monitoring: After submission, monitor the on-chain transaction status. Log transaction hashes and any exceptions. If using WalletConnect, watch for transaction_updated or similar events (if available) to confirm success or failure.

10. Testing & Troubleshooting

Test Matrix: Consider the following scenarios:

Exact-In vs Exact-Out: Verify both swap modes produce correct toTokenAmount or fromTokenAmount.

Slippage Edge Cases: Test 0% slippage (if allowed) and max (5%). Ensure minToTokenAmount vs actual amounts.

Fee Variations: Test with integrator fee = 0%, 1%, 2%. Check feeTokenAmount.

Custom Pools/Sources: Include/exclude specific pools or routes (includePools, excludeSources) to force certain paths.

Error Cases: Invalid token address, mismatched required params, unsupported token pairs should return 400. Out-of-bounds slippage or fee should be sanitized by client.

Wallet Flows: Test all approval/rejection flows in Petra and WalletConnect (user rejects connection, rejects sign request, approves, etc.).

Troubleshooting Tips:

If no quote is returned, check the token addresses and chainId (default is 1). Ensure tokens exist in Panora’s list
docs.panora.exchange
.

A 429 response means rate limiting; implement retry/backoff.

If a transaction fails on-chain, inspect gas usage. Panora’s txData should include appropriate gas; if not, simulate locally to estimate.

For deep link issues (Petra), ensure your app’s URI schema matches redirectLink. Use React Native’s Linking to handle incoming URLs.

For WalletConnect, ensure the URI is properly opened in the wallet (for RN, one can use Linking.openURL with wc: URI).

11. Example Test Cases

Swap APT→USDC (ExactIn): fromTokenAddress=0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin, fromTokenAmount=100, expect toTokenAmount≈<100*price>
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

Swap USDC→APT (ExactOut): toTokenAddress=0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin, toTokenAmount=50, expect fromTokenAmount≈<50/price>.

High Slippage Scenario: Enter slippage=10%. Panora will cap at 5%, and return slippagePercentage=5.

Fee Check: With integratorFeePercentage=1, ensure feeTokenAmount equals ~1% of swap value (in APT).

Include/Exclude Source: Force routes to use/exclude a DEX by includeSources=Hyperion or excludeSources=ThalaSwapV2, and verify output routes.

Wallet Failure: Simulate wallet rejection (click “reject”); ensure the app handles the response=rejected case gracefully with an error message.

Thanks — before I begin, could you confirm:

Do you already have a Panora API key available for test requests, or should I rely only on documentation/examples?

Are you prioritizing Aptos mainnet or testnet integration first (for fetching router contracts and test flows)?

Should the guide target iOS + Android, or can I limit RN examples to one platform?

Once I have that, I’ll begin the research task right away.

Panora Non‑Custodial React Native Integration Guide

Executive summary

This guide explains how to integrate the Panora swap aggregator into a non‑custodial React Native app targeting Aptos. The Panora aggregator provides quotes and transaction data (txData) for swapping one token for another across multiple liquidity sources. A non‑custodial wallet must obtain a quote, present it to the user, then forward the Panora‑supplied transaction to a wallet for signing and submission. This guide synthesises the latest official documentation, SDK examples and on‑chain references (retrieved within the past 90 days) to deliver a complete, copy‑pasteable integration workflow.

Key points covered:

Panora API reference: required and optional fields, integrator fees, slippage, liquidity filters and example requests. The response includes an array of quotes; each quote contains price impact, minimum output and a txData blob that must be executed on‑chain without modification
docs.panora.exchange
docs.panora.exchange
.

On‑chain verification: the Panora router is deployed at 0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c on Aptos mainnet. Fetching its modules from a fullnode shows functions for fees and swapping. A Move contract example calls the router with many generic types and emphasises not to change the argument order
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

React Native integration: complete examples for deep linking into the Petra mobile wallet (including key‑pair generation, encryption and handling of connect, sign‑and‑submit and callback flows
petra.app
petra.app
) and a WalletConnect v2 snippet using the Aptos wallet adapter
aptos.dev
.

Backend pattern: a minimal Node.js service that requests a Panora quote and returns txData to the mobile client. Commands for simulating the transaction using Aptos REST endpoints are included
aptos.dev
.

Security considerations: recommended validation rules, integrator fee limits, encryption best‑practices, and a summary of known issues.

This guide strives to be comprehensive; however, Panora is rapidly evolving. Always monitor Panora’s GitBook and GitHub for the latest breaking changes.

Scope & assumptions

Application type: non‑custodial React Native trading/staking app on Aptos.

Wallets supported: Petra mobile (via deep links) and any WalletConnect v2 compliant wallet supporting Aptos. The guide assumes the user’s private keys never leave their wallet.

Networks: Aptos mainnet (chain ID 1) and testnet/devnet for simulation. Panora only supports Aptos at time of writing; chain selection is controlled by chainId parameter
docs.panora.exchange
.

Permissions: Panora’s /swap endpoint requires an API key. The default demo key from Panora’s docs may be used for testing but production integrators should request their own key.

Recency: All references and code snippets were retrieved or confirmed within 90 days of 2025‑10‑07, unless noted as canonical sources.

Disclaimer: This guide is for informational purposes only. Always perform your own due diligence and security audits before deploying to production.

Quickstart

Follow these three high‑level steps to integrate Panora into your React Native wallet application:

Request a swap quote from Panora’s API. Your backend uses POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap with the required parameters (fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, fromTokenAmount or toTokenAmount, and toWalletAddress) and optional parameters like slippagePercentage and integratorFeePercentage
docs.panora.exchange
. The response includes a quotes array with fields such as toTokenAmount, minToTokenAmount, priceImpact and a txData field
docs.panora.exchange
.

Present the quote to the user and, upon confirmation, forward the txData to a wallet for signing and submission. For Petra mobile, construct a deep link with an encrypted payload and open it using Linking.openURL. The wallet returns a callback with transaction results
petra.app
. For WalletConnect, send the entry_function_payload from txData to signAndSubmitTransaction via the wallet adapter
aptos.dev
.

Monitor the transaction outcome. After submission, poll the Aptos fullnode using the transaction hash or use the wallet callback. Optionally, simulate the transaction using the Aptos SDK before submission to estimate gas and catch failures
aptos.dev
.

1. Panora API reference
1.1 Endpoints and rate limits

Panora exposes a single public endpoint for swaps:

POST https://api.panora.exchange/swap


Rate limits: Panora does not publish a formal rate‑limit policy; however, heavy usage may trigger throttling. Use sensible caching and avoid unnecessary polling. The provided demo API key is not intended for production.

1.2 Request parameters

The request body must be JSON. The following parameters are recognised. Required fields are marked required. All numeric values should be string‑encoded integers representing token amounts in their smallest units (no decimals)
docs.panora.exchange
.

Field	Type	Required	Description
chainId	number	optional	Chain identifier. Use 1 for Aptos mainnet. Defaults to 1
docs.panora.exchange
.
fromTokenAddress	string	required	Fully qualified Move struct address of the input token (e.g. 0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin for APT).
toTokenAddress	string	required	Fully qualified Move struct address of the output token (e.g. USDC).
fromTokenAmount	string	conditionally required	Amount of input token to swap. Use either this or toTokenAmount.
toTokenAmount	string	conditionally required	Desired amount of output token (exact‑out swap). Use either this or fromTokenAmount.
toWalletAddress	string	required	Recipient’s Aptos account address (hex string with 0x prefix).
slippagePercentage	number	optional	Maximum acceptable slippage. Default is Panora’s auto‑calculated recommended slippage
docs.panora.exchange
.
integratorFeePercentage	number	optional	Fee (0–2 %) taken by the integrator. The fee is auto‑swapped to APT and truncated to two decimals
docs.panora.exchange
.
integratorFeeAddress	string	required if integratorFeePercentage > 0	0x‑prefixed hex address (64 hex characters) to receive the integrator fee
docs.panora.exchange
.
includeSources	string[]	optional	List of liquidity sources to exclusively include (e.g. ["Liquidswap", "ThalaSwapV2"]).
excludeSources	string[]	optional	List of sources to exclude.
includePools	string[]	optional	Whitelist of specific pool addresses.
onlyDirectRoutes	boolean	optional	If true, restricts routes to direct token pairs (no multi‑hop).

Slippage and fee rules: Panora will revert a swap if the minimum output is not met. If you provide slippagePercentage, ensure the user understands that a lower slippage may cause transaction failure
docs.panora.exchange
. Integrator fees cannot exceed 2 % and are paid in APT by automatically swapping a portion of the output tokens
docs.panora.exchange
.

1.3 Response structure

Panora responds with an object containing metadata and an array of quote objects. Each quote corresponds to a different route or aggregator source. Key fields include
docs.panora.exchange
:

fromToken / toToken / feeToken: objects describing tokens (address, decimals, symbol, name).

fromTokenAmount, fromTokenAmountUSD: input amount and approximate USD value.

toTokenAmount, toTokenAmountUSD: estimated output and USD value (exact‑in case).

priceImpact: estimated slippage (percentage string).

slippagePercentage: slippage used in the quote (string).

feeTokenAmount: amount of fee token charged.

minToTokenAmount: minimum output guaranteed after slippage (exact‑in case).

maxFromTokenAmount: maximum input allowed (exact‑out case).

txData: an object containing the transaction payload (a nested entry_function_payload ready for submission), the router address and other metadata. Panora’s documentation instructs integrators to send this txData to the user’s wallet without modification
docs.panora.exchange
.

Since the actual txData returned by the API may change, the examples below show a representative structure based on Panora’s current implementation. Always inspect the live API response for your specific token pair.

1.4 Sample requests and responses

The following curl examples demonstrate how to request quotes. Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your Panora API key and <USER_ADDRESS> with the recipient’s Aptos account.

1.4.1 Exact‑in swap (APT → USDC)
curl -X POST "https://api.panora.exchange/swap" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "chainId": 1,
    "fromTokenAddress": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "toTokenAddress": "0x1f2c22c2293c006b08c31ba45b972b03c3839ea5c839618667e3a153980af100::usdc::USDC",

            "0",                      // integrator fee percentage (0 = none)
            "<INTEGRATOR_FEE_ADDRESS>",

          ]
        },

        "route": <...metadata...>
      },
      "toTokenAmountUSD":"12.23"
    }
  ]
}


This example shows the high‑level shape of txData: it contains a payload of type entry_function_payload pointing to the Panora router contract, with generic type arguments describing the swap path, and arguments specifying the sender address, amounts, integrator fee and route details. Do not alter the order or content of these parameters
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

1.4.2 Exact‑out swap (USDC → APT)

    "toTokenAddress": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "toTokenAmount": "500000",  // request to receive 0.5 APT
    "toWalletAddress": "<USER_ADDRESS>",
    "slippagePercentage": 1
  }'


Response (truncated):

{
  "toTokenAmount":"500000",
  "quotes":[{
    "fromTokenAmount":"543210",
    "maxFromTokenAmount":"555555",
    "priceImpact":"0.65",
    "slippagePercentage":"1",
    "feeTokenAmount":"10",
    "txData": { /* similar structure as above */ }
  }]
}

1.5 Integrator parameters

Panora allows integrators to charge a fee by setting integratorFeePercentage (up to 2 %) and specifying an integratorFeeAddress where the fee is paid. The fee portion of the output is automatically swapped into APT and truncated to two decimal places
docs.panora.exchange
. Ensure the fee address is a 64‑character Aptos account starting with 0x
docs.panora.exchange
.

1.6 Supported sources

Panora aggregates liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges on Aptos. Sources include Hyperion, TappExchange, ThalaSwap V2, Cellana, Liquidswap (versions 1 & 2), PancakeSwap and others
docs.panora.exchange
. Use includeSources or excludeSources to fine‑tune which sources are considered.

2. On‑chain verification
2.1 Router address and module inspection

Panora’s swap router is deployed to 0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c on Aptos mainnet. You can verify this by fetching its modules via the Aptos fullnode:

# Retrieve list of modules at the router address
curl -s "https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c/modules" | jq .


The response contains base64‑encoded modules. Decoding them reveals functions such as swap, get_integrator_fee_share_percentage and update_integrator_fee_share
fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com
. A full Move source is not publicly available; however, the Panora contract integration example demonstrates how to call the router.

2.2 Sample Move contract integration

Panora provides a Move sample illustrating how to integrate the router. The contract withdraws the user’s tokens, calls the router and deposits the returned assets. Key takeaways:

The router entry function is panora_swap::router::swap.

It accepts numerous generic type arguments representing the swap path (from token, intermediate tokens and to token). The argument order must not be altered
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

The arguments include the user’s address, fromTokenAmount, minToTokenAmount, integrator fee parameters and route data. After the call returns, leftover coins are deposited back to the user.

You can inspect the full demo.move in the appendix (see raw/demo.move in the repository). Use this example if you need to implement a custodian or on‑chain aggregator.

2.3 Simulating a transaction

Before submitting a swap, simulate the transaction using the Aptos SDK or REST API. The Aptos TS SDK example constructs a transaction payload and calls simulate.simple to estimate gas usage and check for success
aptos.dev
. Use the txData payload from Panora to build the simulation.

# Example simulation using curl (requires base64‑encoded raw transaction and `simulate_transaction` endpoint)
curl -s -X POST https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/transactions/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sender":"<USER_ADDRESS>","payload":<entry_function_payload_from_txData>}'


Alternatively, the TS SDK provides aptos.transaction.simulate.simple
aptos.dev
.

3. React Native implementation
3.1 Petra deep link integration

Petra mobile wallet supports deep linking via petra://api/v1/<endpoint> and encrypts all payloads using public‑key cryptography. The workflow consists of connecting to establish a shared key and then signing & submitting the swap transaction. The official Petra deep‑link document provides detailed code examples
petra.app
petra.app
. The following React Native example encapsulates this logic.

Note: This example uses the Expo environment (expo and expo-linking) and the tweetnacl library for cryptography. Replace YOUR_DAPP_NAME, YOUR_LOGO_URL and YOUR_APP_URL accordingly.

// examples/react-native/petra/App.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import nacl from 'tweetnacl';
import { encode as base64Encode, decode as base64Decode } from 'base64-arraybuffer';

// Helper to generate a new keypair
function generateKeypair() {
  const keypair = nacl.box.keyPair();
  return {
    secretKey: keypair.secretKey,
    publicKey: keypair.publicKey,
  };
}

export default function App() {
  const [dappKeys, setDappKeys] = useState<any>();
  const [sharedKey, setSharedKey] = useState<Uint8Array | null>(null);
  const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Handle the deep link callback from Petra
    const handleDeepLink = (event: Linking.EventType) => {
      const url = event.url || '';
      const params = Linking.parse(url).queryParams as any;
      if (!params) return;

      // Handle connection approval
      if (url.includes('connect')) {
        if (params.response === 'approved') {
          // Decrypt shared key sent by Petra
          const walletPublicKey = new Uint8Array(base64Decode(params.publicKey!));
          const encryptedSharedKey = new Uint8Array(base64Decode(params.encryptedSharedKey!));
          const nonce = new Uint8Array(base64Decode(params.nonce!));
          const shared = nacl.box.open.after(
            encryptedSharedKey,
            nonce,
            walletPublicKey,
            dappKeys.secretKey
          );
          setSharedKey(shared!);
          setUserAddress(params.account);
        }
      }
    };
    const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink);
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, [dappKeys]);

  // Initiate connection to Petra
  async function connectPetra() {
    const keys = generateKeypair();
    setDappKeys(keys);
    const payload = {
      appInfo: {
        name: 'YOUR_DAPP_NAME',
        logoUrl: 'YOUR_LOGO_URL',
      },
      redirectLink: 'yourappscheme://callback',
      dappEncryptionPublicKey: base64Encode(keys.publicKey),
    };
    const dataParam = encodeURIComponent(base64Encode(new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(payload))));
    const url = `petra://api/v1/connect?data=${dataParam}`;
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  }

  // Request signing of Panora txData
  async function signAndSubmit(txData: any) {
    if (!sharedKey || !dappKeys) throw new Error('not connected');
    // Build entry function payload from Panora txData
    const entryPayload = txData.payload;
    const nonce = nacl.randomBytes(nacl.box.nonceLength);
    const message = new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(entryPayload));
    const encrypted = nacl.box.after(message, nonce, sharedKey);
    const signPayload = {
      payload: base64Encode(encrypted),
      nonce: base64Encode(nonce),
      dappEncryptionPublicKey: base64Encode(dappKeys.publicKey),
    };
    const dataParam = encodeURIComponent(base64Encode(new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(signPayload))));
    const url = `petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=${dataParam}`;
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      {userAddress ? (
        <>
          <Text>Connected: {userAddress}</Text>
          {/* Fetch Panora quote from backend and pass txData here */}
          <Button title="Swap now" onPress={() => signAndSubmit(/* txData from backend */)} />
        </>
      ) : (
        <Button title="Connect Petra" onPress={connectPetra} />
      )}
    </View>
  );
}


Explanation:

generateKeypair() creates a key pair for the dApp. The public key is sent to Petra when connecting. Petra uses this to encrypt a shared key.

connectPetra() base64‑encodes a JSON object containing appInfo, a redirectLink (your app’s scheme) and the dApp’s encryption public key
petra.app
. The encoded data is appended to petra://api/v1/connect?data= and opened via Linking.openURL. Petra prompts the user to approve the connection and returns a callback containing the user’s account and an encrypted shared key.

When the callback is received, the app decrypts the shared key using nacl.box.open.after and stores it in state.

To sign a Panora transaction, call signAndSubmit() with the txData from Panora. The function encrypts the entry_function_payload using the shared key and random nonce, constructs the signAndSubmit deep link and opens it
petra.app
. Petra decrypts the payload, shows the transaction details to the user and, on approval, signs and submits it.

3.2 WalletConnect v2 integration

For wallets supporting WalletConnect v2 on Aptos (e.g. Pontem, Fewcha), you can use the Aptos wallet adapter. The adapter provides a React hook to connect and sign transactions. Below is a simplified snippet adapted from Aptos’s wallet adapter docs
aptos.dev
.

// examples/react-native/walletconnect/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AptosWalletAdapterProvider, useWallet } from '@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react';
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { createNetworkClient, Aptos } from '@aptos-labs/ts-sdk';

const client = createNetworkClient('mainnet');

function WalletConnectDemo({ txData }: { txData: any }) {
  const { account, connect, disconnect, signAndSubmitTransaction } = useWallet();

  async function handleSwap() {
    if (!account) {
      await connect();
    }
    // Use txData.payload from Panora
    const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction({
      sender: account!.address,
      data: txData.payload,
    });
    // Wait for confirmation
    const aptos = new Aptos(client);
    await aptos.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: response.hash });
  }

  return (
    <View>
      {account ? <Text>Connected: {account.address}</Text> : <Button title="Connect Wallet" onPress={() => connect()} />}
      <Button title="Swap via WalletConnect" onPress={handleSwap} />
      {account && <Button title="Disconnect" onPress={() => disconnect()} />}
    </View>
  );
}

export default function App({ txData }: { txData: any }) {
  return (
    <AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
      <WalletConnectDemo txData={txData} />
    </AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
  );
}


Notes: The wallet adapter internally uses WalletConnect v2 to communicate with the user’s wallet. When calling signAndSubmitTransaction, pass the entry_function_payload extracted from Panora’s txData
aptos.dev
. After submission, use aptos.waitForTransaction() to await confirmation.

4. Backend pattern

Although your React Native app can call Panora directly, best practice is to proxy swap requests through a backend service that adds an API key, applies integrator logic and caches quotes. Below is a minimal Node.js example using node-fetch.

// examples/backend/node/quoteServer.js
import express from 'express';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const API_KEY = process.env.PANORA_API_KEY;
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/quote', async (req, res) => {
  const body = req.body;
  const response = await fetch('https://api.panora.exchange/swap', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': API_KEY,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // TODO: add validation (see section 5)
  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Quote server running on port 3000'));


Responsibilities:

Receive quote requests from the mobile app.

Forward the request to Panora with your API key and optionally inject integratorFeePercentage and integratorFeeAddress.

Validate and return the first quote (or allow the client to choose). Consider caching responses for several seconds.

Never store private keys or sign transactions on the backend; the user’s wallet should handle signing.

5. Security checklist and validation rules

To protect users and your application, implement the following validations before forwarding txData to wallets:

Verify router address and function. Ensure the function field in txData.payload points to Panora’s router (0x1c3206...::router::swap). Reject transactions targeting unknown contracts
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

Check amounts. Confirm that fromTokenAmount or maxFromTokenAmount match the user’s intent. Use minToTokenAmount to display the minimum expected output. For exact‑out swaps, verify maxFromTokenAmount is reasonable. Reject quotes with missing fields.

Enforce integrator fee limits. Do not exceed 2 % integrator fee. Validate that integratorFeeAddress is 0x‑prefixed and 64 hex characters long
docs.panora.exchange
.

Validate type arguments. Ensure the first and last types in type_arguments correspond to the expected token pair. Be cautious about intermediate types; they represent pool hops.

Check expiration. Validate expiration_timestamp_secs and ensure there is enough time for the user to sign (e.g., at least 2 minutes into the future).

Rate‑limit and cache. Avoid hammering the Panora API; implement caching for identical requests and respect any 429 responses.

Encrypt transaction payloads. When using Petra deep links, always encrypt the payload using the shared key
petra.app
.

Monitor for revert codes. Simulate the transaction before submission to catch issues like insufficient slippage or route deactivation
aptos.dev
.

6. Testing & staging plan
6.1 Testnet endpoints

Panora’s documentation does not explicitly list a testnet API endpoint. Developers typically test on Aptos devnet/testnet by setting chainId to the appropriate value (2 for testnet) and using the same API URL. If the API rejects testnet requests, contact Panora support. For on‑chain simulation, use the Aptos testnet fullnode (https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com).

6.2 Test matrix
#	Scenario	Inputs	Expected outcome
1	Exact‑in happy path	APT → USDC, fromTokenAmount=1 APT, slippage=0.5%	Quote returned with toTokenAmount > 0 and valid txData; transaction executes successfully.
2	Exact‑out happy path	USDC → APT, toTokenAmount=0.5 APT, slippage=1%	Quote returned with reasonable fromTokenAmount and maxFromTokenAmount; transaction executes successfully.
3	Low slippage	APT → USDC with slippage=0.01%	Quote returned; transaction may fail due to slippage; ensure frontend warns user.
4	High integrator fee	integratorFeePercentage=2	Quote returned; ensure fee is converted to APT and fee address receives funds.
5	Exceed fee limit	integratorFeePercentage=3	API should return an error; backend should reject before calling API.
6	Include sources	includeSources=["Liquidswap"]	Quote uses only specified source; verify route and compare price.
7	Exclude sources	excludeSources=["Sushiswap"]	Quote excludes specified source; ensure route differs.
8	Exact‑out with insufficient liquidity	Large toTokenAmount for illiquid pair	API returns error or no quotes; handle gracefully.
9	Petra deep link rejection	User cancels transaction in Petra	Callback contains response=rejected; app should display cancellation.
10	WalletConnect disconnect	User disconnects wallet mid‑swap	Wallet adapter should throw error; handle and prompt user to reconnect.
11	Simulation failure	Simulated transaction returns success=false	Do not submit; show error and refresh quote.
12	Expired quote	Wait until expiration_timestamp_secs passes before signing	Wallet rejects due to expired transaction; request a new quote.
6.3 Staging rollout

Local development: Use testnet and devnet tokens. Validate quoting, simulation and wallet flows.

Internal QA: Deploy the backend to a staging environment with restricted API keys. Test all scenarios in the matrix.

Beta release: Invite a small group of users with small balances. Monitor for edge cases and gather feedback.

Production rollout: Deploy with monitored API keys, enable logging and alerts, and maintain a rollback plan.

7. Monitoring & operations

Metric collection: Track success and failure rates of Panora API calls, average quote latency, and 4xx/5xx responses. Monitor gas_used and priceImpact to detect abnormal behaviour.

Caching & TTL: Cache identical quote requests for 10–30 seconds. Throttle repeated requests from the same user or IP.

Alerting: Set up alerts for high error rates (e.g., >5 % of requests failing) and for Panora rate‑limit responses.

Dependency monitoring: Subscribe to Panora’s changelog and GitHub releases to detect API or contract changes. Re‑verify router addresses on each release.

Fallback plans: If Panora is unavailable, consider disabling the swap feature or routing through other aggregators. Always provide clear user messages.

8. Troubleshooting & FAQ

Q: Why am I receiving Invalid API key errors?

A: Ensure you include the x-api-key header in every request. The demo key in the docs may be rate‑limited; request your own key from Panora.

Q: The txData returned by Panora fails to execute.

A: Verify that you forwarded the txData without modification and that the router address matches the expected address. Check minToTokenAmount vs. actual output; adjust slippage if necessary. Simulate the transaction before submission to catch issues.

Q: How do I get intermediate token types from txData?

A: The type_arguments array in txData.payload lists the path: the first type is the input token, the last is the output token; intermediate types correspond to pool hops. Use this list to display the route.

Q: Does Panora support testnet?

A: Panora has not publicly documented a separate testnet endpoint; however, setting chainId to the testnet chain ID may work. If not, contact support. You can still test transaction signing and simulation on devnet using dummy txData.

Q: Is there a security audit?

A: As of the retrieval date, no public audit report for Panora was found. Always monitor Panora’s announcements for future audits and perform your own code review.

Summary:
Summary of Key Commands for Panora Integration

This summary lists the most important commands to run when integrating Panora swap into a non‑custodial React Native application. Each command is extracted from the full integration guide (integration-guide-panora-noncustodial-2025-10-07.md).

Fetch Panora router modules (on‑chain verification):

curl -s "https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/0x1c3206329806286fd2223647c9f9b130e66baeb6d7224a18c1f642ffe48f3b4c/modules" | jq .

curl -X POST "https://api.panora.exchange/swap" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "chainId": 1,
    "fromTokenAddress": "0x...::USDC::USDC",
    "toTokenAddress": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "toTokenAmount": "500000",
    "toWalletAddress": "<USER_ADDRESS>",
    "slippagePercentage": 1
  }'


Returns a quote and txData for receiving 0.5 APT.

Simulate a transaction using Aptos REST API:

curl -s -X POST https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/transactions/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sender":"<USER_ADDRESS>","payload":<entry_function_payload_from_txData>}'


Evaluates the transaction locally to estimate gas and verify success.

Run the Node.js quote server:

node examples/backend/node/quoteServer.js


Starts a server at localhost:3000 that proxies quote requests to Panora.

Connect Petra via deep link (React Native):

const url = `petra://api/v1/connect?data=${dataParam}`;
await Linking.openURL(url);


Triggers Petra’s connection flow with your dApp encryption public key.

Send signAndSubmit deep link (React Native):

const url = `petra://api/v1/signAndSubmit?data=${dataParam}`;
await Linking.openURL(url);


Opens Petra to sign and submit the encrypted transaction payload.

Connect and submit transaction via WalletConnect v2:

const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction({
  sender: account.address,
  data: txData.payload,
});


Uses the Aptos wallet adapter to prompt the user to sign via their WalletConnect v2 wallet.

Install dependencies for React Native example:

npm install tweetnacl base64-arraybuffer expo-linking @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react @aptos-labs/ts-sdk


Installs required packages for encryption, deep linking and wallet adapter support.

Compile and run the Move sample (optional):

aptos move compile --package-dir raw/demo.move


Compiles the Panora contract integration example for auditing or custom aggregator implementations.

These commands provide a starting point for verifying the router, requesting quotes, simulating transactions and wiring up both Petra and WalletConnect flows.
