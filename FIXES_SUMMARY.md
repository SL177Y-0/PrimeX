## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & DEBUGGING

### Issue 1: Disconnect Button Not Working
**Possible Causes**:
1. Alert dialog not appearing (check console for Alert errors)
2. Extension disconnect failing silently
3. AsyncStorage not clearing properly

**How to Debug**:
1. Open browser console
2. Click disconnect button
3. Look for these logs:
   - `[WalletProvider] Disconnect called` - Should appear immediately
   - `[WalletProvider] Disconnecting from extension` - If using extension
   - `[WalletProvider] Cleaning up local state` - Should always appear
   - `[WalletProvider] Disconnect completed successfully` - Final confirmation

**If logs don't appear**: The button click isn't reaching the handler
**If logs appear but wallet stays connected**: Check for errors in the logs

---

### Issue 2: Balance Not Showing in Swap Interface
**Possible Causes**:
1. Wallet not connected
2. Account address not available
3. Token resources not found on blockchain
4. API rate limiting

**How to Debug**:
1. Open browser console
2. Connect wallet
3. Navigate to swap interface
4. Look for these logs:
   - `[BalanceService] Fetching balances for: <address>` - Should appear on load
   - `[BalanceService] Found X resources` - Should show number of resources
   - `[BalanceService] APT balance: X.XX` - For each token
   - `[BalanceService] Final balances: {...}` - Final result

**If no logs appear**: Balance fetching isn't being triggered
**If logs show 0 resources**: Account might not have any tokens
**If logs show errors**: Check the error message for details

---

### Issue 3: Navigation Still Reloading
**Possible Causes**:
1. React Navigation cache issue
2. State not persisting properly
3. Components remounting for other reasons

**How to Debug**:
1. Check if `lazy: false` and `freezeOnBlur: false` are in `_layout.tsx`
2. Clear app cache and reload
3. Check if components have `key` props that change on navigation

## üîß NEXT STEPS IF ISSUES PERSIST

### If Disconnect Still Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify Alert component is working (test with a simple alert elsewhere)
3. Try adding `console.log('Button clicked')` at the start of `handleDisconnect`
4. Check if the button is actually calling the function

### If Balance Still Shows 0.00:
1. Verify wallet is actually connected (`connected === true`)
2. Check if `account.address` exists and is valid
3. Manually test balance fetching with a known address
4. Check if tokens exist on the account (use Aptos Explorer)
5. Verify `SWAP_TOKENS` addresses are correct for mainnet

### If Navigation Still Reloads:
1. Try adding `detachInactiveScreens={false}` to Tabs component
2. Check if there are any `useEffect` hooks that run on focus
3. Verify no state is being reset on navigation
4. Check React Navigation version compatibility
